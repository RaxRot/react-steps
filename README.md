# ðŸªœ React Steps App

A small React practice project that shows a 3-step process with navigation buttons.

## ðŸ“š What I Learned
- Using **useState** to manage component state
- Updating state with functions and conditional logic
- Rendering **different content based on state**
- Handling events with **onClick**
- Adding **conditional class names** for active steps
